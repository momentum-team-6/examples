This site has three pages:

- Home
- Species
- Facts

## Developer Notes

To get images on your page, you can use a url from [placebear.com](https://placebear.com/) as your image `src` attribute. Or, put image files in the image directory inside this project folder and use the path to each image you want to use.

These screenshots show how your finished site should look:
